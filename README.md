### CSP Shell

CSP Shell or `csh` pronounced *seashell* is a command line interpreter for running CSP and `libparam` based applications.

### spaceinventor/satctl changes name to spaceinventor/csh

`satctl` was originally a piece of software under license from 'Satlab A/S'. Since the current
version of 'spaceinventor/satctl' has nothing to do with satlab or the original `satctl`
we are changing the name of both the software and the repository to avoid any misunderstanding.

The process will be gradual to avoid too many broken links so the old repo will remain in place for a while still.
But the software will be called `csh` (pronounced 'seashell') from now on.


### Build

Requirements: build-essential, libsocketcan-dev, can-utils, libzmq3-dev, libyaml-dev, meson, pkg-config, libgtk-4-dev, libadwaita-1-dev

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsocketcan-dev can-utils libzmq3-dev libyaml-dev pkg-config python3-pip
sudo pip3 install meson ninja
```

Sometimes needed:
```
link /usr/sbin/ninja /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/ninja
```

Build
```
git clone https://github.com/spaceinventor/csh.git
cd csh
git submodule update --init --recursive

meson . builddir
cd builddir
ninja
```

### Run

To setup CAN sudo is required:

sudo ./caninit.sh

On subsequent launches, sudo is not needed.

Then launch two instances
`./csh -f conf1.yaml`
And
`./csh -f conf2.yaml`

Then on instance 1 type `ping 2`

note: you need to setup the two different configuration files, so they can speak to eachother.



Setup can as non root
=====================

Give permission for 'csh' to access network configuration
in order to setup the CAN interface baudrate and +up
When the file is deleted (rebuild) setcap needs to be run
again

    sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep ./builddir/csh
